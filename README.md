Once you are logged in you will come to the main landing page which has information about upcoming events. 

The header to the website will change depending on who is logged in. Below a member has logged in. Our header has four icons, log out, home, profile, cart (left to right). It also displays the number of books we have checked out and the number we can still check out. We can also use the search bar to search for a book within the library.
